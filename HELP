NAME
	SCALCE - tool for compressing FASTQ files.

SYNOPSIS
	scalce [OPTION]... -o [OUTPUT] [FILES]...

DESCRIPTION
	SCALCE will compress provided FASTQ files and generate three output files
	with extension .scalcen (for read names), .scalcer (reads) and .scalceq
	(qualities). The read length should be fixed in any of the mates in one run.
	This means, if you are passing 3 paired libraries, then the read lengths
	mate1 should be fixed (i.e. 50bp). The read lenghts for the second mate could
	be different that the first mate.
	
	Mandatory parameters:
	
	-o, --output
		Specifies the prefix for the output file names. Extensions and basic 
		information will be appended.
		Standard output is supported only when decompressing interleaved file, 
		and it is specified by a dash (i.e scalce -o -).
	
	Shared arguments (both for compression and decompression):

	-b, --file-buffer-size [size][MG]
		Set internal file buffer size (M)egabytes or (G)igabytes. This size is
		used for internal I/O bufering.
		Default: 128M

	-r, --paired-end
		Use paired-end FASTQ files when the two ends are in seprate files. The
		files should be named with _1 and _2. When you are passing it as input, only 
		give _1 file and SCALCE will replace _1 with _2 and read the second file.
		File name Example: XX_1.fq XX_2.fq

	-S, --split-reads [count]
		Split output file to small files with [count] reads each.

	-n, --skip-names [library]
		Discard original read names, and rename each read with the
		library prefix, such as library.1, library.2, ....

	-i, --interleaved
		Use this option when you want the paired-end FASTQ files to be in 
		interleaved format.

	Utility arguments:
	
	-h, --help
		Prints short usage information.
	
	-v, --version 
		Prints the current version of SCALCE.
		
	Decompression arguments:
	
	-d, --decompress
		Uncompress scalce files. Provide just one file name (scalceq for example), 
		and the program will take care for the other files.
	
	Compression arguments:
				
	-B, --bucket-set-size [size][MG]
		Set bucket set size (M)egabytes or (G)igabytes. This parameter limits
		the main memory accessible to SCALCE. Swap files will be used to keep 
		all neccessary data.
		Default: 4G
			
	-c, --compression [mode]
		Select compression mode. Currently available modes are:
			no   - No compression
			gz   - gzip compression level 6
			pigz - parallelized gzip
			bz   - bzip2 compression
		Default: gz if thread count is 1; otherwise pigz
	
	-p, --lossy-percentage [percentage]
		Set lossy error percentage.
		Default: 0 (no lossy)
		
	-s, --sample-size [count]
		Specifies how many quality values should be used for statistical analysis
		during the lossy trasformation table creation.
		Default: 100000
	
	-t, --temp-directory [directory]
		Set directory for holding temporary files. 
		Default: __temp__

	-T, --threads [count]
		Specifies the number of worker threads. If none specified, number of available processors
		will be used.
