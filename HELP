NAME
	SCALCE - tool for compressing Illumina-generated FASTQ files.

SYNOPSIS
	scalce [OPTION]... -o [OUTPUT] [FILES]...

DESCRIPTION
	SCALCE is a FASTQ compression tool designed specifically for the 
	Illumina-generated FASTQ files.

	SCALCE will compress provided FASTQ files and generate three output files
	with extension .scalcen (for read names), .scalcer (reads) and .scalceq
	(qualities). The read length should be fixed in any of the mates in one run.
	This means, if you are passing 3 paired-end libraries, then the read lengths
	in the first mate should be fixed (i.e. 50bp). The read lengths for the 
	second mate could	be different that those of the first mate.
	
	Mandatory parameters:
	
	-o, --output
		Specifies the prefix for the output file names. Extensions and basic 
		information will be appended.
	
	Shared arguments (both for compression and decompression):

	-r, --paired-end
		Use paired-end FASTQ files when the two ends are in separate files. The
		files should be named with _1 and _2. When you are passing it as input, only 
		give _1 file and SCALCE will replace _1 with _2 and read the second file.
		File name Example: XX_1.fq XX_2.fq

	-n, --skip-names [library]
		Discard original read names, and rename each read with the
		library prefix, such as library.1, library.2, ....

	Utility arguments:
	
	-h, --help
		Prints short usage information.
	
	-v, --version 
		Prints the current version of SCALCE.
		
	Decompression arguments:
	
	-d, --decompress
		Uncompress scalce files. Provide just one file name (scalceq for example), 
		and the program will take care for the other files.
	
	Compression arguments:
				
	-B, --bucket-set-size [size][MG]
		Set bucket set size (M)egabytes or (G)igabytes. This parameter limits
		the main memory accessible to SCALCE. Swap files will be used to keep 
		all necessary data.
		Default: 4G
			
	-c, --compression [mode]
		Select compression mode. Currently available modes are:
			no   - No compression
			gz   - gzip compression level 6
			pigz - parallelized gzip
			bz   - bzip2 compression
		Default: gz if thread count is 1; otherwise pigz

	-A, --no-arithmetic
		Disable arithmetic coding for the quality compression and use default 
		compression mode. This helps reduce both compression and decompression time, 
		but the compression ratio may suffer. 
		Default: not activated
	
	-p, --lossy-percentage [percentage]
		Set lossy error percentage.
		Default: 0 (no lossy)
		
	-s, --sample-size [count]
		Specifies how many quality values should be used for statistical analysis
		during the lossy transformation table creation.
		Default: 100000
	
	-t, --temp-directory [directory]
		Set directory for holding temporary files. 
		Default: __temp__

	-T, --threads [count]
		Specifies the number of worker threads. If none specified, SCALCE will use 4
		worker threads, or less if the number of available processors is less than 4.
		will be used.
