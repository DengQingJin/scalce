## So what is SCALCE?

SCALCE (`/skeÉªlz/`, a.k.a. boosting <u>S</u>equence <u>C</u>ompression <u>A</u>lgorithms using <u>L</u>ocally <u>C</u>onsistent <u>E</u>ncoding) is a tool for compressing FASTQ files. It is designed specifically for the Illumina-generated FASTQ files, but supports any valid FASTQ with consistent read lengths. SCALCE was publised in [Bioinformatics in October 2012][3].


## How do I get SCALCE?

Just clone our repository and issue `make` command:

	git clone https://github.com/sfu-compbio/scalce.git
	cd scalce && make -j

Alternatively, use:

	git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/scalce/scalce \
		scalce-scalce

If you don't have git, you can always fetch pre-packaged SCALCE archives:

-	[.zip package](https://github.com/sfu-compbio/scalce/zipball/master)
-	[.tar.gz package](https://github.com/sfu-compbio/scalce/tarball/master) 

> **Note**: You will need [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) >= 1.2.6 and [libbzip2](http://www.bzip.org/) library to compile the sources. Unfortunately, RHEL/CentOS 5.x and older come with antiquated versions of zlib, so we recommend downloading the newer version from the web. [pigz](http://zlib.net/pigz/) is also recommended for multi-threaded mode. See [Usage](#usage) for explanation.


## How do I use SCALCE?

SCALCE is invoked as following:

-	**Compression**
		
		scalce [input_1.fastq] -o [result]
		
	Compress `input_1.fastq` to the files `result.00_1.scalcen.gz`, `result.00_1.scalcer.gz` and `result.00_1.scalceq.gz`.

		scalce [input_1.fastq] -r -o [result] -n [library]

	Compress `input_1.fastq` together with its paired end `input_2.fastq`, discarding the names and setting library name to `library`.

-	**Decompression**
		
		scalce [input_1.scalcen] -d -o [something.fastq]
	
	This will decompress `input_1.scalce\*` SCALCE file to `something.fastq`.
